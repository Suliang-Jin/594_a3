            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to humor rating task! üéâ</p>
            <p>In this task, you will see an <em>original news headline</em> and an <em>edited version with one word replaced</em>. Your goal is to rate how funny the edited version is (less funny üëé, mediocre üòê or funny üëç). Then, please tell us how much you understand the context of the headline. Optionally, you can provide a reasoning on your humor rating. </p>
            <p>*Note: the headlines are from real news reports and probably contain political contents. Also, the headlines and the edited versions are directly obtained from a CS publication dataset <em>SemEval-2020 Task 7</em>. </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Original headline:</strong> WHO calls for <span style="color: blue;">elimination</span> of trans fat by 2023</p>
            <p><strong>Edited headline:</strong> WHO calls for <span style="color: blue;">monetization</span> of trans fat by 2023</p>
            <p>As you see, the replaced word is elimination ‚Üí monetization. You can rate the edited headline with [less funny üëé], [mediocre üòê] or [funny üëç], and tell us how much you understand the context of the headline.</p>
